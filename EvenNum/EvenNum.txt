An even number is divisible by 2 and an odd number is not. Your task is to write code that determines if an integer is divisible by 2 or not.

Given an integer, i, greater than zero, if i is even, return the string "true". If i is odd, return the string "false".

Input Format

Input is a single integer, i.

Constraints

0 < i <= 1000

Output Format

Output is a single string, either "true" or "false".

Sample Input 0

4
Sample Output 0

true
Explanation 0

4 is an even number since 4 is divisible by 2. The program returns "true".
