FizzBuzz: You are given an integer, x. If x is divisible by 3, return the string “Fizz”. If x is divisible by 5, return the string “Buzz”. If x is divisible by both 3 and 5 return the string “FizzBuzz”. If x is NOT divisible by either 3 or 5, just return the integer x as a string.

Input Format

Input for testcases is handled for you and is stored as the integer variable, x.

Constraints

1 <= x <= 100

Output Format

One string: either "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the integer x (as a string).

Sample Input 0

12
Sample Output 0

Fizz
Explanation 0

Since 12 is divisible by 3 (and not by 5), return the string "Fizz".

Sample Input 1

10
Sample Output 1

Buzz
Explanation 1

Since 10 is divisible by 5 (and not by 3), return the string "Buzz".

Sample Input 2

2
Sample Output 2

2
Explanation 2

Since 2 is NOT divisible by either 3 or 5, return 2 as a string.
